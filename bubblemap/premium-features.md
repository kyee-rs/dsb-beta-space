# Premium features

**Why Choose Premium Access?**

For users who are serious about understanding the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, the Premium plan delivers the ability to track more complex wallet interactions, identify large token movements, and receive better customer support for their activities. Whether youâ€™re an individual investor, a project manager, or a security auditor, the Premium plan provides the tools needed to make data-driven decisions, protect your investments, and optimize your strategy in the decentralized market.

**Unlimited Bubblemap Scans**

Both Basic and Premium users enjoy unlimited access to our Bubblemap scanning feature. However, with Premium, users benefit from an enhanced experience that includes the ability to scan more wallets and nodes within the same map, gaining a broader perspective on token distribution and transaction paths.

**Comprehensive Bubblemap Scan History**

While Basic users have limited access to past scans, Premium members unlock comprehensive scan history. This feature enables users to review past wallet interactions, observe changes in token movements over time, and analyze patterns that may indicate market manipulation or suspicious activity. Tracking historical scans is crucial for long-term investors and analysts who want to understand how wallet behavior evolves over the lifecycle of a token.

**Max 60 Wallets per Bubblemap**

One of the biggest advantages of Premium access is the increased wallet capacity per Bubblemap. Premium users can track up to 60 wallets per Bubblemap, compared to the 30-wallet limit for Basic users. This expanded capacity provides a more detailed and holistic view of wallet relationships, especially for tokens with a large user base or complex network of transactions. Being able to visualize interactions between more wallets at once enables deeper analysis of how token supply is distributed and how it might affect market behavior.

**Expand Nodes and Clusters**

Premium members unlock the ability to expand nodes and clusters within the Bubblemap. This feature provides more detailed information about wallets that are part of the same cluster, allowing users to track token movements between closely related wallets. Expanding nodes can reveal patterns of wallet coordination, market manipulation, or even potential security risks, such as a whale controlling multiple wallets to avoid detection. By analyzing these clusters in greater detail, users can make informed decisions about the safety and stability of their investments.

**Live Bubblemap (Coming Soon)**

The upcoming Live Bubblemap feature will allow Premium users to observe token movements in real-time, providing immediate insights into large token transfers, whale movements, and market dynamics. This is a critical tool for users who need to respond quickly to changes in token distribution, such as during a token launch, liquidity injection, or a whale dump. Live Bubblemaps will be an essential feature for day traders, liquidity providers, and token project managers who need to monitor the market continuously.

**Priority Support**

Premium members receive priority customer support, ensuring faster response times and more personalized assistance. Whether you need help navigating the platform, interpreting data, or addressing potential issues with your Bubblemaps, our team will prioritize your inquiries and provide you with the support needed to make the most out of your Premium features.
