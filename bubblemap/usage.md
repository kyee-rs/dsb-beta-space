# Introduction

**Problem**

The cryptocurrency ecosystem faces significant challenges related to market transparency, token distribution, and security concerns. Unseen risks such as market manipulation, suspicious wallet activity, and centralization of token holdings can undermine trust in new projects. Key players, such as deployers and whales, often exploit vulnerabilities in tokenomics, creating unfair advantages that lead to price manipulation, sudden sell-offs, or even rug pulls.

**How We Solve It**

The Bubblemap provides an intuitive and visual solution for analyzing token ecosystems by mapping out wallet interactions and connections. It allows users to clearly identify relationships between the deployer, sniper nodes, and holders. By visually tracking how tokens move between wallets, we highlight areas where control of token supply might be centralized or potentially manipulated. This in-depth view allows users to spot unusual wallet clustering, large-scale accumulations, and suspicious trading patterns in real-time.

**Why Security Matters**

Without proper insights into how tokens are distributed and controlled, investors and users are exposed to potential market abuse. The Bubblemap addresses these concerns by providing clarity around the movement of tokens and helping users detect early signs of security risks, such as liquidity manipulation or supply concentration in a few hands. Understanding these behaviors not only protects users from fraud but also ensures fair market participation and transparency within token economies.

This tool is essential for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of token dynamics, protect their investments, and ensure the security and fairness of the blockchain ecosystem.
