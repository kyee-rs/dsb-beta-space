# Deployer

A "Deployer" is the individual responsible for creating a new cryptocurrency token and setting up its associated liquidity pool. This involves deploying the token’s smart contract on a blockchain, defining its parameters (such as total supply and distribution), and establishing the initial liquidity pool, which allows the token to be traded on decentralized exchanges. The Deployer typically has significant control over the token’s initial distribution and market dynamics.
