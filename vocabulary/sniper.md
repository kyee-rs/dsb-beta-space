# Sniper

A "sniper" in the context of cryptocurrency trading refers to an individual or bot that strategically positions themselves to execute the first transaction(s) in a new liquidity pool or token launch. This is typically done by bundling their transaction for creating liquidity with their own initial purchase(s) of the token, ensuring they are the first to buy at the lowest possible price, often securing an advantageous position before others have the chance to act.
