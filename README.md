**Introducing the Bubblemap DApp**

Our Bubblemap DApp for Solana tokens is a cutting-edge tool designed to visualize and explore the intricate web of wallet activities within the Solana ecosystem. By leveraging this DApp, users can easily track and analyze various wallet interactions, including those of snipers, deployer wallets, and bundle snipes. The Bubblemap DApp offers an intuitive way to understand clusters of wallets and their interconnectivity, providing a clear and interactive representation of token distribution and movements across the network.



**Key Features**

_Sniper Identification:_ Easily identify wallets involved in sniper activities, providing insights into trading behavior.

_Deployer Wallet Tracking:_ Monitor the activities of deployer wallets to understand the initial distribution and subsequent movements of tokens.

_Bundle Snipe Analysis:_ Utilize Jito to detect and track bundle snipes, giving you a deeper understanding of high-volume trading events.

_Cluster Interconnectivity:_ Visualize how different wallet clusters are connected, offering a comprehensive view of the token’s ecosystem.



**Using the DevSellingBot on Telegram**

The DevSellingBot is designed to provide users with comprehensive analytics on Solana chain tokens through an intuitive and easy-to-use Telegram interface. Here’s how you can get started:

_Download Telegram:_ Install the Telegram application on your device. It’s available for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and more.

_Access the Bot:_ Open the app and use the search function to find @is\_dev\_selling\_bot. Alternatively, you can use this [quick access link](https://t.me/is\_dev\_selling\_bot) to navigate directly to the bot.

_Initiate a Conversation:_ Once you’ve accessed the bot, click on the Start button.

_Follow the Setup Steps:_ The bot will guide you through a few preliminary steps, which might include joining certain channels to gain full access to the bot’s features.

_Input the Token Contract Address (CA):_ In the chat, paste the token’s contract address and press Send.

_Receive the Report:_ The bot will process the data and return a detailed report on the token’s activity. This may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the token’s activity level.

_Review Key Metrics:_ The bot provides a comprehensive breakdown of liquidity, market capitalization, liquidity pool status, and more.

_Generate a Bubblemap:_ If desired, you can generate a Bubblemap directly within the report. This interactive visual representation makes it easier to understand the token’s wallet distribution and interactions.



**Integrating the Bot with the Bubblemap DApp**

One of the standout features of the **DevSellingBot** is its ability to generate a Bubblemap directly within the Telegram interface, using an iframe. This seamless integration allows users to quickly switch between detailed report analysis and visualizing wallet interconnections, enhancing the overall experience and making it easier to interpret complex data.
