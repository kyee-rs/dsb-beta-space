# Successful Sniper Repors

Successful Sniper Reports have a lot of similarities with regular scan reports and a much information in common. On this page I will briefly explain only the Wallet Activity element, other elements could be looked up on the [Successful Scans](successful-scan-reports.md) page.

Starting with the wallet activity we see the first distinguishable element, second holding line. Let's start from the beginning.

1. **X** wallets sniped **Y**% - This element shows how much of a total supply was sniped in the first \[~~redacted~~] blocks.
2. â€¢ (**A** wallets holding **B**%) - How many wallets still hold any supply. B - the total percentage of hold by those wallets.
3. ðŸ”« ADDRESS B: X / S: Y - How much an address has bought/sold. (Layer 0 - Head)
4. ADDRESS B: X / S: Y - First layer participant wallet (Layer 1)
