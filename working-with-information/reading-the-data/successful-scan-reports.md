# Successful Scan Reports

After you've received a reply from DSB you might get a little confused of seeing all the information. We should break the successful scan report into pieces and have a detailed look on the each one.

On this screenshot you might see a few key-points that should draw your attention but let's start from the top.

1. Ticker - Short code for each token, usually a shortened name ($DSB, $SC, $BTC)
2. <mark style="color:red;">Mintable status</mark> - **This should always be a "No"**. Otherwise a big  üö©red flag.
3. Additional labels - entry shows any additional information about the token. Usually is not considered a safety concern unless the "‚ö†Ô∏è" emoji is present.

4. Pool - The liquidity pool DEX platform (Raydium, Orca, PumpFun)&#x20;
5. <mark style="color:red;">LP Status</mark> - What % of a LP token supply was burned. Usually 100% is required and considered a good practice. If the LP Status is <100%, the Dev can withdraw the liquidity and "liquidate" the token's price to 0$.
6. Liquidity - Current liquidity value of a token (USD).
7. <mark style="color:red;">Supply Airdropped</mark> - % of supply of a token that was airdropped from the Dev to other wallets. The lower value is the better.&#x20;

2. üë∑üèª XYZ2 - This emoji specifies developers' wallets. (Could be >1 if first mint was performed to multiple wallets)
3. XYZ2 (Wallet) - Shows a wallet that was involved in developers' transactions of a token.
4. (2) - Amount of "[Next Layer](../../vocabulary/layered-transfers.md)" transactions.
5. B: 0.0 SOL / S: 0.1 SOL - Total swapped value of every wallet.
